# Operators
Comparison operators compare two things using in the script and it gives you a result using Boolean: true or false. Example: 
x=4, y=7

X<y 

True

Other example of comparison operators are: >, ==, etc.

Logical operators compare the results of two or more comparison operators and it also give the result as true or false. Example:

X<y && y>x

True

Other example of logical operators:

&& (and)
|| (or)

Loops allow the condition to run multiple times until it reaches false result. For loop is when you want the condition to run for a specific number of times and it needs a counter that should start with 0. While loop runs until it reaches false as a result, and do while keeps rung even when the result is false. A more typical use of awhile loop would be when you do not know how many times you want the code to run. It should continue to run as long as a condition is me.
