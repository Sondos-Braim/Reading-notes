# Java Script


JavaScript works along with HTML and CSS to create a website. Each one of them has a different purpose but they are usually three sheets linked in the HTML file. JavaScript is written using the same tools used for HTML and CSS. When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML file and you link them using the tag <script> or you could put it in a separate file. You use <script> to add the JavaScript file in the HTML file.


A JavaScript file contains a number of statements. Scripts contain instructions. You could specify a value to a variable in order to use it in some calculations.
