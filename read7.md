# JavaScript
JavaScript can make the page interact with the user and make dynamic output depending on the input it gets every time. We can also modify a web page content using JavaScript. In order to write a script, you need to be familiar with the languages that the computer understands. The script is basically a number of rules given to the machine to perform certain operations.

The way you write JavaScript is similar to writing HTML and CSS but it has the extension (.js). Before you start with the actual writing, you need to have a set of goals that you want to achieve. Then you can write the steps and then the rules. When you write the rules, you can make conditions, so a different output will be given according to the input. 

Using JavaScript, you can assign a value to a variable. Expressions can assign a value to a variable or two values that need to be calculated.

OPERATORS

We use operators to create a single value from more than two values.

Arithmetic operators: we use them with numbers.

+, -, /, *

String operators: we use them with strings (texts).

+

Logical operators: they deal with Boolean so the result is true or false

&&, ||

Functions are used in the JavaScript files to make the reading more organized or to call the function when you want to reuse the task.
