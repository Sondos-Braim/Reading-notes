# JavaScript
JavaScript can make the page interact with the user and make dynamic output depending on the input it gets every time. We can also modify a web page content using JavaScript. In order to write a script, you need to be familiar with the languages that the computer understands. The script is basically a number of rules given to the machine to perform certain operations.

The way you write JavaScript is similar to writing HTML and CSS but it has the extension (.js). Before you start with the actual writing, you need to have a set of goals that you want to achieve. Then you can write the steps and then the rules. When you write the rules, you can make conditions, so a different output will be given according to the input.
