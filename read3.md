Version control is found in Git and GitHub and it allows you to save previous versions of the files so you can compare the versions or go back to a previous one. There is a Local version control that is found on your device and remote version control that you can access via the internet. 
Git allow us to benefit from these features: snapshots, local operations, and so many others. You can work on Git locally by using command lines. So you can open files, write and edit on your device and then you can move what you created on GitHub on the cloud by something called cloning. You can clone the files on your GitHub by something called ACP that you run in your command line.
