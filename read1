#Markdown Syntax Style
GitHub uses the Markdown syntax to style the writings on the platform. This is a very easy way of styling your texts. It is very similar to the way you would usually style your text on Microsoft word but Markdown can be done on websites online. You can make the text bold, Italics, underlined, and so many other options.
You can add all of these effect online only by knowing very simple codes and then applying them to the text. For example, if you want to italicize a word, you only have to add (*) before and after it.
The best thing in the Markdown syntax in my opinion is that we can use different emojiâ€™s so your website would be very colorful and fun! The process of adding an emoji is very simple and you can access the codes on their website with the codes for a huge number of them.
GitHub is the perfect place for you to share your content with the world with simple steps. You can easily create your repositories on this site without even the need for databases or even the knowledge of HTML.
