# Growth Mindset

To have a *growth mindset* is a very important factor if you want to lead a successful life. If you want to have a growth mind set you should always remind yourself of the following:
- [Always remember that you are important and that you matter and that you can make a change.](https://sondos-braim.github.io/Reading-notes/You%20can%20make%20a%20change.md)
- [Do **Not** compare yourself to other people.](https://sondos-braim.github.io/Reading-notes/Do%20not%20compare.md)
- [Start your day with positive thinking.](https://sondos-braim.github.io/Reading-notes/Positive%20Thinking.md)
