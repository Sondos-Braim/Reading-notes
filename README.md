# Growth Mindset

To have a *growth mindset* is a very important factor if you want to lead a successful life. If you want to have a growth mind set you should always remind yourself of the following:
- Always remember that you are important and that you matter and that you can make a change.
- Do **Not** compare yourself to other people.
- Start your day with positive thinking.
