# CSS

CSS is the what we include in our codes to design our website. It helps with creating the layout to your page. It can also change colors everything associated with styling the page. CSS codes work with HTML element so they have a certain way to interact with each other so that we get the result of the styled website with the content needed. You can select a certain part of the HTML codes to apply the CSS to. 


CSS could be inside the HTML codes in the same sheet or it can be done externally and then we link it to the HTML sheet, which is the recommended way. One of the major features in CSS is the color to the texts and the background. It is very important to color the website so you should not underestimate it. You can add the colors using three methods: color name, hex codes, and RGB values.
